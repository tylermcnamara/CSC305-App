# Budget Buddy Business Plan

## Lean Canvas Approach

We plan to make use of the 1-page [Lean Canvas](https://www.leanfoundry.com/tools/lean-canvas) plan template created by Ash Maurya, adapted from Alex Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas and optimized for Lean Startups.

The Lean Canvas design encourages speed and dynamic design as a dynamic model in contrast to previous static plan models. The plan is easy-to-read and highlights the immediate unique value of a product.
