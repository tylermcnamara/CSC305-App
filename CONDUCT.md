# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our organization a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy organization.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our organization include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The SCRUM master has a responsibility to clarify and enforce our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

We, as a group, have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all organization spaces, and also applies when an individual represents the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting inn our Discord, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Decisions 
As a group we will make descions based on a majority rule.

## Attendance 
If a group member can not attend a project either in person or virutally, they must inform the group ahead of time. We expect that each group member are be for at least one group meeting each week.

Some legitimate reasons for being absent could be for family or medical reasons. The missing member will communicate with other group members so they can know what tasks they need to do.

## Assignments 
While assignments are to be worked on together, they are graded as individual work--so as long as the group member does their part of the group portion, it is ultimately up to the indivudal group member to turn in their part online.

## Participation 
We will be actively communicating in-person and virtually. Whether that be through in class project meetings, over text messages, or through a virtual call. 

## Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums 
We will meet every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday during class time. In addtion to this we will also be meeting every Fridays virtually over Discord at 3:30 PM.

In terms of notes from the meeting, we will make sure to inform the group member who is absent from the meeting of anything they need to do.

## Cell Phone Usage
As stated by Dr. Fay-Wolfe, there will be no phones out during project meetings.

## Enforcement

An instance of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the SCRUM master:
tyler_mcnamara@uri.edu
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The SCRUM master will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Group Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with

### 3. Temporary Ban
