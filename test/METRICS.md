- Metric 1 - Log-in Tracking - Thunkable will send information to the backend every time the user logs in, including date and time. All information pertinent to login will be tracked on the backend, including the ID of the user logging in, the date of the user logging in, and the time of the user logging in, which can be compiled for broader stats.
- Metric 2 - NPS - We will have a quick question once the user logs out where it will ask "How likely are you to recommend Budget Buddy to a friend?" From a scale of 1 - 10.
- Metric 3 - Number of Users - Firebase will keep track of how many users have signed up to make an account. We can track the growth and popularity of Budget Buddy though the amount of accounts have been made.
- Metric 4 - User Retention Rate - Tracked by google analytics on our backend, we can track the percentage of new users that return each day for a chosen period of time. We can track this retention rate over different periods of time, and for different groups of users. 
- Metric 5 - how to collect
