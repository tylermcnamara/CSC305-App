- A/B Test Name: Pie Chat/Doughnut Chart
- User Story Number: UI/UX Design
- Metric: Engagement
- Hypothesis: Since users can see their total amount in their weekly budget in a doughnut chart, I hypothesize that users would rather have a doughnut chart than a pie chart with their total below the chart.
